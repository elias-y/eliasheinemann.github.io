    <h1>Elias Heinemann</h1>
    <p>I am a Master Student in Mathematics at the Technical University Munich.
      Currently on Erasmus at the Université Grenoble Alpes for the last semester of my studies.
      My interests in Mathematics include Partial Differential Equations, Functional Inequalities and Probability Theory.
      During my Bachelor degree I completed a minor in Computer Science, which gives me the technical abilities to solve real world problems.
      Due to these studies and an internship, I have experience with Large Language Models.

    <p>This is my personal website. I use it for my CV, blog posts, and academic notes.</p>
